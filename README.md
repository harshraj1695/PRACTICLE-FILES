### Binary Search

Binary Search is a searching algorithm used to find the position of a target element within a sorted array. It efficiently narrows down the search space by repeatedly dividing it in half until the target is found.

### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer technique. It selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, sorting them recursively. Quick Sort is known for its efficiency and is widely used for sorting large datasets.

### Strassen Matrix Multiplication

Strassen Matrix Multiplication is an algorithm that optimizes matrix multiplication by reducing the number of basic arithmetic operations. It divides the matrices into sub-matrices and uses recursive calls to compute the product with fewer multiplications.

### Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used for finding the minimum spanning tree in a connected, undirected graph. It operates by sorting the edges by weight and adding them to the spanning tree if they do not create a cycle.

## [Agile Practices](https://github.com/harshraj1695/PRACTICLE-FILES/tree/main/Agile)

### Agile Development

Agile Development is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It prioritizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback. Common practices include Scrum, Kanban, and continuous delivery.

### JUnit Testing

JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java that supports unit testing. It provides annotations for identifying test methods and assertions to validate expected outcomes. Automated testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and catching regressions.

### Testing Using Selenium

Selenium is a popular tool for automating web browser interactions, commonly used for web application testing. It enables the simulation of user actions and the verification of expected behaviors.

### Xtreme Programming Scenario

Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology emphasizing rapid delivery, flexibility, and customer satisfaction. In an Xtreme Programming scenario, developers work closely with customers, employing practices like pair programming, continuous integration, and frequent releases to ensure high-quality software.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to conducting and documenting various experiments related to Git and Github. Each experiment is designed to test specific hypotheses, gather data, and make informed decisions to improve the project.
## Experiment 1: Git Installation and Repository Creation

**Objective:**
In this experiment, we installed Git, created a local Git repository, and established a connection with a remote repository on GitHub. Additionally, a GitHub account was created to store the remote repository.

**Steps:**
1. Install Git on your local machine.
2. Create a new local Git repository using the `git init` command.
3. Connect the local repository to a remote repository on GitHub.
4. Set up a GitHub account for remote repository storage.

## Experiment 2: Branch Creation and Merging

**Objective:**
In this experiment, we focused on branching in Git. A new branch was created on GitHub, and changes were made within that branch. Finally, the changes from the branch were merged into the main branch.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new branch on GitHub using the branch creation feature.
2. Make changes within the newly created branch.
3. Merge the changes from the branch into the main branch using the GitHub interface.

## Experiment 3: Pull Requests and Merging Changes

**Objective:**
The objective of this experiment was to introduce and explore the pull request command. Pull requests were created to propose changes, and these changes were merged both in the local repository and on the remote repository.

**Steps:**
1. Create and explore the pull request command on GitHub.
2. Propose changes using a pull request.
3. Merge the changes locally using Git commands.
4. Merge the changes on the remote repository through the GitHub interface.
