## Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)

### Binary Search

Binary Search is a searching algorithm used to find the position of a target element within a sorted array. It efficiently narrows down the search space by repeatedly dividing it in half until the target is found.

### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer technique. It selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, sorting them recursively. Quick Sort is known for its efficiency and is widely used for sorting large datasets.

### Strassen Matrix Multiplication

Strassen Matrix Multiplication is an algorithm that optimizes matrix multiplication by reducing the number of basic arithmetic operations. It divides the matrices into sub-matrices and uses recursive calls to compute the product with fewer multiplications.

### Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used for finding the minimum spanning tree in a connected, undirected graph. It operates by sorting the edges by weight and adding them to the spanning tree if they do not create a cycle.

## Agile Practices

### Agile Development

Agile Development is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It prioritizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback. Common practices include Scrum, Kanban, and continuous delivery.

### JUnit Testing

JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java that supports unit testing. It provides annotations for identifying test methods and assertions to validate expected outcomes. Automated testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and catching regressions.

### Testing Using Selenium

Selenium is a popular tool for automating web browser interactions, commonly used for web application testing. It enables the simulation of user actions and the verification of expected behaviors.

### Xtreme Programming Scenario

Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology emphasizing rapid delivery, flexibility, and customer satisfaction. In an Xtreme Programming scenario, developers work closely with customers, employing practices like pair programming, continuous integration, and frequent releases to ensure high-quality software.
