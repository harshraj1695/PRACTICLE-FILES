### Binary Search

Binary Search is a searching algorithm used to find the position of a target element within a sorted array. It efficiently narrows down the search space by repeatedly dividing it in half until the target is found.

### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer technique. It selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, sorting them recursively. Quick Sort is known for its efficiency and is widely used for sorting large datasets.

### Strassen Matrix Multiplication

Strassen Matrix Multiplication is an algorithm that optimizes matrix multiplication by reducing the number of basic arithmetic operations. It divides the matrices into sub-matrices and uses recursive calls to compute the product with fewer multiplications.

### Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used for finding the minimum spanning tree in a connected, undirected graph. It operates by sorting the edges by weight and adding them to the spanning tree if they do not create a cycle.
